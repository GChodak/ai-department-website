abstract: The paper presents method of hybrid prediction system for debt portfolio
  appraisal. Based on the local area competence, time spread repayment values are
  predicted by means of hybrid combination of various machine learning techniques.
  The above methods include among others clustering of references, model selection
  and enrichment of input variables with prediction outputs from preceding periods.
  Experimental studies concern the method's configuration influence on its general
  performance such as number of distinct predictors and
