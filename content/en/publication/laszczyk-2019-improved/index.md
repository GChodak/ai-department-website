abstract: In this paper a modified selection operator is presented in combination
  with classical Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II). It is shown
  that various modifications can lead to increased convergence, spread or uniformity
  of achieved Pareto fronts. A clone prevention method is used to increase the spread
  of resulting sets. Furthermore a crowding operator is removed from the NSGA-II as
  it serves a similar purpose as the clone prevention, even though it achieves it
  in a different manner. The former enforces diversity in a
