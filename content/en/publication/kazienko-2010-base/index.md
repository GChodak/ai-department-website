abstract: Boosting as a very successful classification algorithm represents a great
  generalization ability with appropriate ensemble diversity. It can be easily applied
  in the two-class classification problem. However, sequential structure prediction,
  in which the output is an ordered list of the labeled classes, needs to be realized
  by an adjusted and extended version. For that purpose the AdaBoostSeq algorithm
  has been introduced. It performs the multi-class classification with respect to
  the sequential structure of the classification target
