abstract: Laborious construction of large wordnets (lexico-semantic networks) can
  be supported by automatic wordnet expansion methods. Several methods were proposed
  but mostly were not thoroughly evaluated and compared. In the paper an evaluation
  methodology for automated wordnet expansion algorithms is proposed. Basic requirements
  for it are formulated in relation to the linguistic process. The general scheme
  based on the idea of automated wordnet reconstruction is presented. The methodology
  is illustrated by applying it
