abstract: The article discusses new approach for possible theoretical solution for
  the support of architectural design of floor plans in a computational way, presents
  theoretical design guidelines regarding the application supporting the architectural
  design process and briefly describes specification for the first implementation
  of the application prototype from the perspective of an architect supporting the
  architectural design process by accelerating the initial conceptual design phase
  via the computational creation of architectural floor layouts
