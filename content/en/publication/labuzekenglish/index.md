abstract: The paper presents the structure of a biadirectional PolishaEnglish machine
  translation system. Since it was created mostly as a commercial proda uct, such
  aspects as speed of translation, dealing with ungrammatical texts and time and cost
  of developing the system are of big importance. An attempt of solving these problems
  by the application of Machine Learning techniques in parsing and tagging is discussed.
