abstract: The problem of finding optimal set of users for influencing others in social
  networks has been studied for more than ten years. As it has been shown, it is a
  NP-hard problem, so since than some heuristics were proposed as suboptimal solutions.
  Still, one of the commonly used assumption is the one that seeds are chosen on the
  static network, not the temporal one. This static approach is in fact far from the
  real-world networks, where new nodes may appear and old ones dynamically disappear
  in course of time. An alternative and
