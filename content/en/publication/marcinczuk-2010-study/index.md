abstract: Accuracy of a Named Entity Recognition algorithm based on the Hidden Markov
  Model is investigated. The algorithm was limited to recognition and classification
  of Named Entities representing persons. The algorithm was tested on two small Polish
  domain corpora of stock exchange and police reports. Comparison with the base lines
  algorithms based on the case of the first letter and a gazetteer is presented. The
  algorithm expressed 62% precision and 93% recall for the domain of the training
  data. Introduction of the simple hand
