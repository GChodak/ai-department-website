abstract: A framework for multi-label classification extended by Error Correcting
  Output Codes (ECOCs) is introduced and empirically examined in the article. The
  solution assumes the base multi-label classifiers to be a noisy channel and applies
  ECOCs in order to recover the classification errors made by individual classifiers.
  The framework was examined through exhaustive studies over combinations of three
  distinct classification algorithms and four ECOC methods employed in the multi-label
  classification problem. The experimental results
