abstract: The paper presents an agent called Learning Assistant, which is responsible
  for defining individual learning paths for pupils in e-learning environment. The
  Assistant is able to infer using metadata described pupils and didactic materials;
  this inference is a basis for building the individual learning path for each pupil.
  To build a learning path for a new pupil the agent uses information collected during
  introductory tests. A SOM neural network is used for grouping similar pupils. WebTeacher
  is e-learning environment in which Learning Assistant
