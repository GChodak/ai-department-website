abstract: This article presents the results of a survey regarding architects' expectations
  towards software for automated floor plan generation (AFPG) and optimisation processes
  in architectural design. More than 150 practising architects from Poland and abroad
  took part in the survey. Survey results were then extracted, ordered and interpreted
  with the use of data mining. The survey structure, methodology and analytical tools
  used are described in the paper.
