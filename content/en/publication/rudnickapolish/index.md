abstract: The paper presents the strategy of mapping plWordNet to Princeton WordNet
  and explores its potential applications in translation practice. The very concept
  of wordnet is shortly described, together with the pecularities of the structure
  (and underlying methodology) of Princeton WordNet and plWordNet. We introduce a
  set of hierarchically ordered inter-lingual relations and the mapping procedure
  used for the linking of the two wordnets. Next, the role of those inter-lingual
  relations in finding translation equivalents is discussed.
