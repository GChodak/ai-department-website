abstract: In this article some novel scheduling heuristics for Multi-Skill Resource-Constrained
  Project Scheduling Problem have been proposed and compared to state-of-the-art priority
  rules, based on task duration, resource salaries and precedence relations. New heuristics
  stand an aggregation of known methods, but are enhanced by skills domain. The goal
  of the paper is to investigate, whether evaluated methods can be used as robustness
  enhancement tools in metaheuristics, mostly evolutionary algorithms. Experiments
  have been performed using
