abstract: One of the most interesting topics in social network science are social
  groups. Their extraction, dynamics and evolution. One year ago the method for group
  evolution discovery (GED) was introduced. The GED method during extraction process
  takes into account both the group members quality and quantity. The quality is reflected
  by user importance measure. In this paper the influence of different user importance
  measures on the results of the GED method is examined and presented. The results
  indicate that using global
