abstract: 'The paper describes an application of Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search
  Procedure (GRASP) in solving Multi–Skill Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling
  Problem (MS-RCPSP). Proposed work proposes a specific greedy–based local search
  and schedule constructor specialised to MS-RCPSP. The GRASP is presented as the
  better option to classical heuristic but also as a faster and successful alternative
  to another metaheuristic. To compare results of GRASP to others approaches, various
  methods are proposed: methods'
