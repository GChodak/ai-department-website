abstract: 'Over the years, several theoretical graph generation models have been proposed.
  Among the most prominent are: the Erdős–Renyi random graph model, Watts–Strogatz
  small world model, Albert–Barabási preferential attachment model, Price citation
  model, and many more. Often, researchers working with real-world data are interested
  in understanding the generative phenomena underlying their empirical graphs. They
  want to know which of the theoretical graph generation models would most probably
  generate a particular empirical'
