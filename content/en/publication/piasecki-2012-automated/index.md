abstract: We present a machine learning approach to the generation of derivative relations.
  Instances of derivative relations described in a wordnet are used in the bootstrapping
  approach to build an analyser of derivational relations. plWordNet derivational
  relations are presented and the planned semi-automatic wordnet expansion with derivational
  relations is discussed. Limits to which form-based markers can encode semantic distinctions
  are analysed and a model of semantic post-filtering of the generated derivational
  relation instances is presented.
