abstract: The main objective of this paper is to propose an effective evolutionary
  method for solving the problem of working paths optimization in survivable MPLS
  network. The paper focuses on existing network, in which only network flow can be
  optimized to provide network survivability using the local repair strategy. The
  problem is NP-complete, the solution space of the test cases is large and many genes
  are required to code the potential solution. Recently, the MuPPetS method (Multi-Population
  Pattern Searching Algorithm for Flow
