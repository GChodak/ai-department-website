abstract: The paper presents a feature-based model of equivalence targeted at (manual)
  sense linking between Princeton WordNet and plWordNet. The model incorporates insights
  from lexicographic and translation theories on bilingual equivalence and draws on
  the results of earlier synset-level mapping of nouns between Princeton WordNet and
  plWordNet. It takes into account all basic aspects of language such as form, meaning
  and function and supplements them with (parallel) corpus frequency and translatability.
