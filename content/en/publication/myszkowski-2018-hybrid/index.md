abstract: Paper presents a hybrid Differential Evolution and Greedy Algorithm (DEGR)
  applied to solve Multi-Skill Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem. The
  specialized indirect representation and transformation of solution space from discrete
  (typical for this problem), to continuous (typical for DE-approaches) are proposed
  and examined. Furthermore, Taguchi Design of Experiments method has been used to
  adjust parameters for investigated method to reduce the procedure of experiments.
  Finally, various
