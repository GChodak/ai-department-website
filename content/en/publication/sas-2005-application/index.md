abstract: 'In this paper the application of novel three-level recognition concept
  to processing of some structured documents (forms) in medical information systems
  is presented. The recognition process is decomposed into three levels: character
  recognition, word recognition and form contents recognition. On the word and form
  contents level the probabilistic lexicons are available. The decision on the word
  level is performed using results of character classification based on a character
  image analysis and probabilistic lexicon treated as a'
