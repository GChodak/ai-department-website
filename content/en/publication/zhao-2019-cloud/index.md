abstract: In this paper, we present Optimisation as a Service (OaaS) for an integrated
  process planning and scheduling in smart factories based on a distributed multi-criteria
  genetic algorithm (GA). In contrast to the traditional distributed GA following
  the island model, the proposed islands are executed asynchronously and exchange
  solutions at time points depending solely on the optimisation progress at each island.
  Several solutions' exchange strategies are proposed, implemented in Amazon Elastic
  Container Service for Kubernetes
