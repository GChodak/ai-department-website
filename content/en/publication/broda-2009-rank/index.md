abstract: Rank weight functions had been shown to increase the accuracy of measures
  of semantic relatedness for Polish. We present a generalised ranking principle and
  demonstrate its effect on a range of established measures of semantic relatedness,
  and on a different language. The results confirm that the generalised transformation
  method based on ranking brings an improvement over several well-known measures.
