abstract: The problem of sequence prediction ie annotating sequences appears in many
  problems across a variety of scientific disciplines, especially in computational
  biology, natural language processing, speech recognition, etc. The paper investigates
  a boosting approach to structured prediction, AdaBoost STRUCT, based on proposed
  sequence-loss balancing function, combining advantages of boosting scheme with the
  efficiency of dynamic programming method. In the paper the method's formalism for
  modeling and predicting label
