abstract: This paper presents an application of coevolutionary algorithms to rule
  discovery on stock market. We used genetic programming techniques with coevolution
  in financial data mining process. There were tested a various approaches to include
  coevolution aspects in task of build trading rule (buy and sell decision). Trading
  rules are based on technical and fundamental indicators included in decision tree
  and were tested on Warsaw Stock Exchange historical data.
