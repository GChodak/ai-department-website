abstract: In this article two approaches of Tabu Search in Multi-Skill Resource-Constrained
  Project Scheduling Problem (MS-RCPSP) have been proposed, based on different neighbourhood
  generation methods. The first approach assumes swapping resources assigned to pair
  of tasks, while the second one proposes assigning any resource that could perform
  given task. Both approaches need to respect the skill constraints. The objective
  of this paper is to research the usability and robustness of proposed approaches
  in solving MS-RCPSP
