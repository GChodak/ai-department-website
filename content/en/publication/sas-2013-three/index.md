abstract: In the paper the combined approach to the problem of text region recognition
  problem is presented. We focused our attention on the chosen case of text extraction
  problem from specific type of images where text is imposed over graphical layer
  of vector images (charts, diagrams, etc.). For such images we proposed three-stage
  method using OCR tools as some kind of feed-back in process of text region searching.
  Some experimental results and examples of practical applications of recognition
  method are also briefly described.
