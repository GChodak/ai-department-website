abstract: All online sharing systems gather data that reflects users' collective behavior
  and their shared activities. This data can be used to extract different kinds of
  relationships which can be grouped into layers and which are basic components of
  the multidimensional social network (MSN) proposed in the paper. The layers are
  created on the basis of two types of relations between humans, ie, direct and object-based
  ones which, respectively, correspond to either social or semantic links between
  individuals. For better understanding of the

  and Humans*'
