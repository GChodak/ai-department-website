abstract: Graph energy is the energy of the matrix representation of the graph, where
  the energy of a matrix is the sum of singular values of the matrix. Depending on
  the definition of a matrix, one can contemplate graph energy, Randić energy, Laplacian
  energy, distance energy, and many others. Although theoretical properties of various
  graph energies have been investigated in the past in the areas of mathematics, chemistry,
  physics, or graph theory, these explorations have been limited to relatively small
  graphs representing chemical
