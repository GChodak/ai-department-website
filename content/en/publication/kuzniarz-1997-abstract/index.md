abstract: A model for data in multimedia systems is presented. It includes the notions
  of elementary and composed data, synchronisation points, stream, multimedia stream
  and beam (of multimedia streams). Some aspects and constrains of temporal composition
  are regarded. Operators for composition of beams are introduced and two kinds of
  composition are defined. A possible implementation of the model in SML is outlined.
  The model is also referred to the technical standard-MME. All notions are given
  their representation in RIFF
