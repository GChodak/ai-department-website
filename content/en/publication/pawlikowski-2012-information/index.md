abstract: The paper presents a method of information extraction from overview maps.
  The idea is based on recognizing text located on the map and on finding locations
  corresponding to the extracted text labels using the GeoNames ontology. The method
  consists of three phases. The first one performs map image processing in order to
  recognize text labels. The next phase verifies these labels and marks them as being
  sure or unsure locations. In the third phase the map is interpreted based on the
  locations found. The second and third phases
