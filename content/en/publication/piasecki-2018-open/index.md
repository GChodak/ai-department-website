abstract: "WebSty is an open, web-based stylometric system designed for Social Sciences\
  \ & Humanities (SS&H) users. It was designed according to the CLARIN philosophy:\
  \ no need for installation, minimised requirements on the users' technical skills\
  \ and knowledge, and focus on SS&H tasks. In the paper, we present its latest extension\
  \ with several visualisation methods, techniques for the extraction of characteristic\
  \ features, and support for multilinguality."
