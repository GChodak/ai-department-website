abstract: Apart from many project design decisions that have to be made when incorporating
  blockchain as a trusted transactions register, it is also essential to gain a deeper
  understanding of the ecosystem when it already entered operational state. By looking
  at the way how nodes perform transactions, how they cluster, or what is the dynamics
  of the network, many valuable insights can be derived about the condition of the
  whole system. This leads to improving functionality, performance, scalability, and
  security. We propose a
publication: '*2020 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks
  Analysis and Mining (ASONAM)*'
