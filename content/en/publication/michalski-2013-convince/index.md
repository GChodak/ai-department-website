abstract: Humans utilise multiple communication channels in their social interactions
  and also information diffusion as well as the spread of influence are practically
  related with many contexts. Each such context (channel) may represent a different
  communication method or a different environment of a given person. This facilitates
  building multiple social networks, that are not independent. They share the same
  set of nodes connected with many links grounded on different layers-these networks
  are called multi-layered or multiplex social
