abstract: Profile cloning is a severe security issue in social networks since it is
  used to make a profile identical to existing ones. Profile cloning detection creates
  a possibility to detect frauds that would use people's trust to gather social information.
  This paper proposes two novel methods of profile cloning detection and also presents
  state-of-the-art research. The first method is based on the similarity of attributes
  from both profiles and the second method is based on the similarity of relationship
  networks. The methods are further evaluated with
