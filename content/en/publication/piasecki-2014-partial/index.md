abstract: A corpus-based Measure of Semantic Relatedness can be calculated for every
  pair of words occurring in the corpus, but it can produce erroneous results for
  many word pairs due to accidental associations derived on the basis of several context
  features. We propose a novel idea of a partial measure that assigns relatedness
  values only to word pairs well enough supported by corpus data. Three simple implementations
  of this idea are presented and evaluated on large corpora and wordnets for two languages.
