abstract: Many real-world problems are notoriously multi-objective and NP-hard. Hence,
  there is a constant striving for optimizers capable of solving such problems effectively.
  In this paper, we examine the Multi-Objective Parameter-less Population Pyramid
  (MO-P3). MO-P3 is based on the Parameter-less Population Pyramid (P3) that was dedicated
  to solving single-objective problems. P3 employs linkage learning to decompose the
  problem and uses this information during its run. P3 maintains many different linkage
  information sets, which is the
publication: '*Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference
  Companion*'
