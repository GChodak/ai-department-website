abstract: The paper presents a new re-built and expanded, version 2.0 of WordnetLoom–an
  open wordnet editor. It facilitates work on a multilingual system of wordnets, is
  based on efficient software architecture of thin client, and offers more flexibility
  in enriching wordnet representation. This new version is built on the experience
  collected during the use of the previous one for more than 10 years of plWordNet
  development. We discuss its extensions motivated by the collected experience. A
  special focus is given to the development of a
publication: '*Proceedings of the 9th Global Wordnet Conference*'
