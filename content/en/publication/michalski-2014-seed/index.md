abstract: The problem of finding optimal set of users for influencing others in the
  social network has been widely studied. Because it is NP-hard, some heuristics were
  proposed to find sub-optimal solutions. Still, one of the commonly used assumption
  is the one that seeds are chosen on the static network, not the dynamic one. This
  static approach is in fact far from the real-world networks, where new nodes may
  appear and old ones dynamically disappear in course of time. The main purpose of
  this paper is to analyse how the results of one of the
