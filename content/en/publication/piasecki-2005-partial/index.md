abstract: The paper presents the variant of partial parsing method (PPM) applied to
  acquisition of expert rules from a Polish medical text. PPM is based on the premise
  that knowledge domain is already defined by knowledge engineer (ie names for classes,
  attributes, values etc.). The definitions are automatically translated from natural
  language into formal expressions stored partially in knowledge base and partially
  in semantic dictionary. PPM preserves composi-tionality principle and is based on
  sublanguage method. Subsequent
