abstract: Linkage learning is frequently employed in state-of-the-art methods dedicated
  to discrete optimization domains. Information about linkage identifies a subgroup
  of genes that are found dependent on each other. If such information is precise
  and properly used, it may significantly improve a method's effectiveness. The recent
  research shows that to solve problems with so-called overlapping blocks, it is not
  enough to use linkage of high qualityâ€“it is also necessary to use many different
  linkages that are diverse. Taking into account that
