abstract: We propose an evolutionary algorithm (EA) usage to image clustering applied
  to Document Search Engine (DSE). Each document is described by its visual content
  (including images), preprocessed and clustered by EA. Next, such clusters are core
  of DSE. However, number of documents and attached images make EA ineffective in
  such task. Using the natural issue of EA we propose GPGPU (General Purpose Graphic
  Processing Unit) implementation. The paper describes our proposition, research and
  results gained in experiments.
