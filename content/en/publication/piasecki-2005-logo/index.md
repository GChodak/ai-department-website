abstract: Our paper presents a modular architecture for a natural dialogue system.
  The architecture is applied in the construction of Logo-a dialogue system for Polish,
  based on the Discourse Representation theory, implementing some aspects of the pragmatic
  analysis and enabling communication with an agent acting in the virtual reality
  of a blocks world. Logo deals also with the selected issues of coreference resolution.
  The proposed architecture is intended to be flexible and open for utilisation of
  diverged language resources.
