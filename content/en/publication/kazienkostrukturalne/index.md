abstract: Links are the specific feature of hypertext documents and the primary part
  of hypertext structure. The important information about semantic relations between
  documents is encapsulated within them. This information can be used to point out
  similarity function. In the paper four, new structure similarity functions were
  described. They can be usefull in the WWW environment. The automatic link type detection
  was utilized in these functions (semantic and navigational links can be distinguished).
