abstract: (NIDS) must analyze a large volume of data while not placing a significant
  added load on the  monitoring systems and networks. This paper presents a framework
  for a distributed network  intrusion detection system (dNIDS) based on the artificial
  immune system concept. In this
publication: '*2016 IEEE First International Conference on Connected Health: Applications,
  Systems and Engineering Technologies (CHASE)*'
