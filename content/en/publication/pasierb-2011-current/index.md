abstract: A discussion on matters arising from encountered problems while designing
  and introducing e-health systems is presented in this paper. In particular, some
  difficulties in the adaption of ICT to e-health systems have been emphasised. Additionally,
  the future vision of healthcare evolution by means of information technology is
  analysed. Questions which arose as to the main challenges for healthcare systems
  were both technological and non-technological.
