abstract: The concept of the new hybrid method for debt portfolio repayment prediction
  has been presented and examined. The method provides functionality for repayment
  value prediction over time that describes the recovery profile of the debt portfolio.
  Experimental studies on hybrid combination of various data mining methods like clustering
  and decision trees into one complex process revealed usefulness of the proposed
  method for claim appraisals.
