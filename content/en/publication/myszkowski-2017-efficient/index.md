abstract: This paper presents multiple variances of selection operator used in Non-dominated
  Sorting Genetic Algorithm II applied to solving Bi-Objective Multi-Skill Resource
  Constrained Project Scheduling Problem. A hybrid Differential Evolution with Greedy
  Algorithm has been proven to work very well on the researched problem and so it
  is used to probe the multi-objective solution space. It is then determined whether
  a multi-objective approach can outperform single-objective approaches in finding
  potential Pareto Fronts. Additional modified selection
