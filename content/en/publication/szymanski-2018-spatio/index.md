abstract: 'In recent years, many studies on urban mobility based on large data sets
  have been published: most of them are based on crowdsourced GPS data or smart-card
  data. We present, what is to the best of our knowledge, the first exploration of
  public transport delay data harvested from a large-scale, official public transport
  positioning system, provided by the Wrocław municipality. We introduce the methodology
  to analyze the distribution of delays in public transport, enabling the improvement
  of timetables by making them more'
