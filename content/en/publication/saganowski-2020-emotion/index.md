abstract: Wearables like smartwatches or wrist bands equipped with pervasive sensors
  enable us to monitor our physiological signals. In this study, we address the question
  whether they can help us to recognize our emotions in our everyday life for ubiquitous
  computing. Using the systematic literature review, we identified crucial research
  steps and discussed the main limitations and problems in the domain.
