abstract: 'One of the basic methods of web usage mining are association rules that
  indicate relationships among common use of web pages. Positive and confined negative
  association rules are the components of the new quality measures: Positive and Negative
  Quality function, respectively. These functions are used to evaluate the quality
  of hyperlinks existing on web pages. A number of statistics and the expert validation
  revealed the usefulness of association rules for the assessment of hyperlink usability.'
