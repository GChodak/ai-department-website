abstract: In the Evolutionary Computation field, it is frequent to assume that a computation
  load necessary for fitness value computation is, at least, similar for all possible
  cases. The main objective of this paper is to show that the above assumption is
  frequently false. Therefore, the examples of evolutionary methods that use problem
  encoding which allows for significant optimization of the fitness computation process
  are pointed out and analyzed. The definition of Problem Encoding Allowing Cheap
  Fitness Computation of Mutated Individuals
