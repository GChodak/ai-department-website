abstract: The task of determining labels of all network nodes based on the knowledge
  about network structure and labels of some training subset of nodes is called the
  within-network classification. It may happen that none of the labels of the nodes
  is known and additionally there is no information about number of classes (types
  of labels) to which nodes can be assigned. In such a case a subset of nodes has
  to be selected for initial label acquisition. The question that arises is:“labels
  of which nodes should be collected and used for learning
