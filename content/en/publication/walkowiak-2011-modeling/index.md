abstract: Various solutions based on Peer-to-Peer (P2P) multicasting have been gaining
  much popularity in recent years, since P2P multicasting can effectively support
  live streaming of various content. In this work we assume that the P2P multicasting
  is used to distribute content with high reliability requirements, eg, weather warnings,
  security updates, financial data, security warnings, etc. The main idea to provide
  protection of the system against network failures is to establish several (at least
  two) disjoint multicasting trees. Our
publication: '*Computer Communications*'
