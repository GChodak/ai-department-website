abstract: We have released plWordNet 3.0, a very large wordnet for Polish. In addition
  to what is expected in wordnets–richly interrelated synsets–it contains sentiment
  and emotion annotations, a large set of multi-word expressions, and a mapping onto
  WordNet 3.1. Part of the release is enWordNet 1.0, a substantially enlarged copy
  of WordNet 3.1, with material added to allow for a more complete mapping. The paper
  discusses the design principles of plWordNet, its content, its statistical portrait,
  a comparison with similar resources, and a
publication: '*Proceedings of COLING 2016, the 26th International Conference on Computational
  Linguistics: Technical Papers*'
