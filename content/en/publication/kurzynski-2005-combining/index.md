abstract: In this paper the probabilistic aproach to handwritten words recognition
  is described. The decision is performed using results of character classification
  based on a character image analysis and probabilistic lexicon treated as a special
  kind of soft classifier. The novel approach to combining these both classifiers
  is proposed, where fusion procedure interleaves soft outcomes of both classifiers
  so as to obtain the best recognition quality. The proposed algorithms were experimentally
  investigated and results of recognition of polish
