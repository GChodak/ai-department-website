abstract: A key challenge of the Information Extraction in Natural Language Processing
  is the ability to recognise and classify temporal expressions (timexes). It is a
  crucial source of information about when something happens, how often something
  occurs or how long something lasts. Timexes extracted automatically from text, play
  a major role in many Information Extraction systems, such as question answering
  or event recognition. We prepared a broad specification of Polish timexes–PLIMEX.
  It is based on the state-of-the-art annotation
