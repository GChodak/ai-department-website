abstract: In every company, employees are in communication via phone, email, text
  messages, chats on a forum, co-author documents, events, and so forth. They collaborate
  with each other creating and maintaining mutual relationships in one complex social
  network. In this paper, the authors use this social network to evaluate company
  structure and based on this evaluation recommend some changes that have to be made
  within a company to improve its structure. The evaluation process and an example
  of its usage are presented in the paper.
