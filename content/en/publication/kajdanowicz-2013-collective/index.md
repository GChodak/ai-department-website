abstract: 'Collective classification is the area in machine learning, in which unknown
  nodes in the network are classified based on the classes assigned to the known nodes
  and the network structure only. Three collective classification algorithms were
  described and examined in the paper: Iterative Classification (ICA), Gibbs Sampling
  (GS) and Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP). Experiments on various networks revealed
  that greater number of output classes decreases classification accuracy, GS provides
  better results than ICA and LBP outperforms'
