abstract: A recently started project on building the Polish wordnet (called plWordNet)
  is the background to the presented work. The goals of the project and the linguistic
  structure of plWordNet are described. The assumptions of the planned semi-automatic
  method of extending the initial core wordnet to its full size are presented. A multi-criteria
  algorithm of extraction of lexical semantic relations is presented. Several problems
  with application of the known methods of relation extraction to Polishâ€“an inflectional
  and free word order language
