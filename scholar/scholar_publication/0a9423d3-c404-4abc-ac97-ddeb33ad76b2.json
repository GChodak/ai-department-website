    "abstract": "Clothing segmentation is a challenging field of research which is rapidly gaining attention. This paper presents a system for semantic segmentation of primarily monochromatic clothing and printed/stitched textures in single images or live video. This is especially appealing to emerging augmented reality applications such as retexturing sports players' shirts with localized adverts or statistics in TV/internet broadcasting. We initialise points on the upper body clothing by body fiducials rather than by applying distance metrics to a",
