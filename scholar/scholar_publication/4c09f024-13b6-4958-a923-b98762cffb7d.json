    "abstract": "A collocation \u2013 a group of words \u2013 is a multi-word lexical unit if 1. it belongs to terminology, or  2. it is semantically non compositional, or 3. it exhibits some syntactic irregularity. These three  criteria are applied in a sequence of tests. A term must be defined either in an  encyclopaedia, or in a specialist lexicon or domain dictionary. Non-compositionality is tested  by combining the elements of a collocation into a semantic paraphrase, which may also contain  dictionary definitions of words and their derivational cognates. A combination of words is considered",
