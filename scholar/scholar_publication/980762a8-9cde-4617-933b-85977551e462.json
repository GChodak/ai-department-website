Previous work can be computationally intensive and is mainly based on low-level cues extracted from RGB data and implemented on a PC for a fixed sensor network (such as traditional CCTV). We present a practical and efficient framework for mobile devices (such as smart phones and robots) where high-level semantic soft biometrics are extracted from RGB and depth data. By combining these cues, our approach attempts to", "organization": "IEEE", "pages": "125--131", "booktitle": "2015 11th International Conference on Signal-Image Technology \\& Internet-Based Systems (SITIS)", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "cushen2015person"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7400555/", "author_id": ["sIwtMXoAAAAJ"], "num_citations": 2, "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:7GuhB567xK0J:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DA%2BPerson%2BRe-Identification%2BSystem%2BFor%2BMobile%2BDevices%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&json=&update_op=library_add&info=7GuhB567xK0J&ei=zVNeYfTBMY2UmQGz6rqYBQ", "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=12521339151404067820&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:7GuhB567xK0J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=A+Person+Re-Identification+System+For+Mobile+Devices&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.04133"}
