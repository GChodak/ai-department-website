    "abstract": "Predicting the future direction of community evolution is a problem with high theoretical and practical significance. It allows to determine which characteristics describing communities have importance from the point of view of their future behaviour. Knowledge about the probable future career of the community aids in the decision concerning investing in contact with members of a given community and carrying out actions to achieve a key position in it. It also allows to determine effective ways of forming opinions or to protect group participants",
